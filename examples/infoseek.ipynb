Among the BAA's first presidents was Walter Maunder, discoverer of the seventeenth century dearth in sunspots now known as the Maunder Minimum which he achieved by analysing historical observations. Later, this spirit of observing the night sky scientifically was championed by George Alcock, who discovered five comets and five novae using nothing more than a pair of binoculars.The BAA continues to contribute to the science of astronomy, even despite modern competition from space-based telescopes and highly automated professional observatories. Modern digital sensors, coupled with techniques such as lucky imaging, mean that even modest amateur equipment can rival what professional observatories could have achieved a few decades ago. The vastness of the night sky, together with the sheer number of amateur observatories, mean that BAA members are often the first to pick up new phenomena. In recent years, the Association's leading supernova hunter, Tom Boles (President 2003–5), has discovered over 150 supernovae. He now holds the world record for the greatest number of such events discovered by any individual in history.More recently the BAA has worked increasingly with international partners. Modern communications allow astronomers in different time zones around the world to hand over the monitoring of variable stars and planetary weather systems to colleagues on other continents as the Sun comes up, resulting in a 24-hour watch on the sky.

By 1989 it had reached visual magnitude 17.38.DM Geminorum faded from peak brightness by 2 magnitudes in just 6 days, making it a \"very fast nova\".All novae are binary stars, with a \"donor\" star orbiting a white dwarf. The two stars are so close together that matter is transferred from the donor to the white dwarf. High speed photometry done with the 1.2 meter telescope at the Whipple Observatory show a small amplitude (0.25 magnitude peak-to-peak) oscillation with a period of 2 hours and 57 minutes, which is probably the orbital period of the binary system. In addition, brightness variations with a period of 22 minutes are also seen in this star's light curve. The star's spectrum and brightness variations are similar to what is seen in intermediate polars.\n",
      "The British Astronomical Association (BAA) was formed in 1890 as a national body to support the UK's amateur astronomers.Throughout its history, the BAA has encouraged observers to make scientifically valuable observations, often in collaboration with professional colleagues. Among the BAA's first presidents was Walter Maunder, discoverer of the seventeenth century dearth in sunspots now known as the Maunder Minimum which he achieved by analysing historical observations. Later, this spirit of observing the night sky scientifically was championed by George Alcock, who discovered five comets and five novae using nothing more than a pair of binoculars.The BAA continues to contribute to the science of astronomy, even despite modern competition from space-based telescopes and highly automated professional observatories. Modern digital sensors, coupled with techniques such as lucky imaging, mean that even modest amateur equipment can rival what professional observatories could have achieved a few decades ago. The vastness of the night sky, together with the sheer number of amateur observatories, mean that BAA members are often the first to pick up new phenomena. In recent years, the Association's leading supernova hunter, Tom Boles (President 2003–5), has discovered over 150 supernovae. He now holds the world record for the greatest number of such events discovered by any individual in history.More recently the BAA has worked increasingly with international partners. Modern communications allow astronomers in different time zones around the world to hand over the monitoring of variable stars and planetary weather systems to colleagues on other continents as the Sun comes up, resulting in a 24-hour watch on the sky. For example, the Association's Variable Star Section works closely with the American Association of Variable Star Observers, meanwhile its Jupiter Section works with a global network of planetary observers through the JUPOS collaboration.\n",
      "CTA 102, also known by its B1950 coordinates as 2230+114 (QSR B2230+114) and its J2000 coordinates as J2232+1143 (QSO J2232+1143), is a blazar-type quasar discovered in the early 1960s by a radio survey carried out by the California Institute of Technology. It has been observed by a large range of instruments since its discovery, including WMAP, EGRET, GALEX, VSOP and Parkes, and has been regularly imaged by the Very Long Baseline Array since 1995. It has also been detected in gamma rays, and a gamma-ray flare has been detected from it.In 1963 Nikolai Kardashev proposed that the then-unidentified radio source could be evidence of a Type II or III extraterrestrial civilization on the Kardashev scale. Follow-up observations were announced in 1965 by Gennady Sholomitskii, who found that the object's radio emission was varying; a public announcement of these results on April 12, 1965, caused a worldwide sensation. The idea that the emission was caused by a civilization was rejected when the radio source was later identified as one of the many varieties of a quasar.CTA 102 is one of the two great false alarms in the history of the search for extra-terrestrial life, the other being the discovery of pulsars, specifically PSR B1919+21, which are rotating neutron stars.The American folk rock band The Byrds whimsically reflected the original view that CTA-102 was a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence in their song \"C.T.A.-102\" from their 1967 album \"Younger Than Yesterday\".In late 2016 CTA 102, usually glowing around magnitude +17, had a bright outburst in visible light to magnitude +11 (~250 times brighter than usual). This likely was the most luminous blazar state ever observed, with an absolute magnitude in excess of -32.A new outburst began in December 2017, with increased gamma-ray and optical activity. As of 22 December 2017, it has reached magnitude +14.\n",
      "41 Tauri is a single-lined spectroscopic binary system in the zodiacal constellation of Taurus; \"41 Tauri\" is its Flamsteed designation. The star has a visual magnitude of 5.19, making it visible to the naked eye from brighter suburban skies (according to the Bortle scale). Parallax measurements put it at a distance of roughly 404 light years from the Sun.This is a chemically peculiar star and was first classified as a silicon star by American astronomer William Morgan in 1933. The stellar spectrum displays an overabundance of heavier elements; particularly silicon and gallium. These abundances may be caused by the magnetic field of the star, which produces concentrations of the observed elements in the outer atmosphere. It is an α² Canum Venaticorum-type variable star, ranging in magnitude from 5.15 down to 5.22. These variations are likely due to large spots or rings on the side of the star being observed.The star and its companion orbit each other closely with a period of a week and an eccentricity of 0.18. The rotation period of the primary star has become locked to its orbit, so that one face is always pointed toward its companion. The abundance of gallium and silicon varies in a sinusoidal pattern that matches this period.The primary has around 2.9 times the mass of the Sun, 3.5 times the Sun's radius, and is emitting 190 times the luminosity of the Sun. The effective temperature of the star's photosphere is 12,600 K, giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star.\n",
      "Binocular disparity refers to the difference in image location of an object seen by the left and right eyes, resulting from the eyes’ horizontal separation (parallax). The brain uses binocular disparity to extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal images in stereopsis. In computer vision, binocular disparity refers to the difference in coordinates of similar features within two stereo images.A similar disparity can be used in rangefinding by a coincidence rangefinder to determine distance and/or altitude to a target. In astronomy, the disparity between different locations on the Earth can be used to determine various celestial parallax, and Earth's orbit can be used for stellar parallax.\n",
