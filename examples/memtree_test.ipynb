This includes Newsweek, Maclean\\'s, CBC, and The Guardian. The following are selected media and outreach activities. In 2011, her work on plastic assessment in northern marine birds, “Plenty of plastics in Canada’s Arctic birds” was written by Margaret Munro, science writer and journalist. In 2012, the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern development Canada (AANDC) produced a video featuring Provencher’s work with Inuit to study Eider Ducks. Provencher was also featured in Duck’s Unlimited’s magazine, The Conservator, for this Fellowship winning work. In 2015, the Smithsonian magazine featured Provencher in an article highlighting how seabirds act as vectors of marine contaminants dumped back on land. She was then interviewed in 2017 for CBC reports on the billions of plastic particles brought into Arctic waters through the ocean ‘conveyor belt’. In 2018, Provencher and the minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, visited Nova Scotia, as they discussed plastic pollution and its threat to seabirds and the Atlantic coast. The minister later expressed her pride to have worked with such a dedicated public servant as Provencher, mentioning that Provencher\\'s talk about work-life balance was an important message. That same year, she was part of a CBC radio coverage about a UK ban of plastic straw and other single use items and what could be done in Canada, titled \"\\'We need to rethink the entire plastics industry\\': Why banning plastic straw isn\\'t enough.\" In 2019, she was featured in a Maclean\\'s article \"Is That My Plastic Bag in the Mariana Trench?\" and was one of three guest plastic researchers part of a live panel discussion about the plastics in the oceans at the 2019 Advancement of Science meeting, Washington, D.C.', parent_id='http://jenniferprovencher.com/::sec8', leaf_id='http://jenniferprovencher.com/::sec8::leaf0', metadata={'section_index': 8, 'section_title': 'Media and outreach', 'paragraph_index': 0, 'source_url': 'http://jenniferprovencher.com/'}, text_hash='d9e0e56798a93cc6ea7a6666f914bea90d6e933e'), LeafNode(text='\"Reports and Newsletters – ACUNS/AUCEN\".
