Taoist Tai Chi is not a sport in the traditional sense, but rather a form of physical training and meditation.\n\nRegarding the discovery or invention of Taoist Tai Chi, it is traditionally attributed to the late 20th-century Chinese martial artist and philosopher Yang Jwing-Ming. He developed Taoist Tai Chi as a modern interpretation of traditional Chinese martial arts, incorporating elements from various styles such as Tai Chi Chuan, Baguazhang, and Xingyi Quan.

The breeding season extends from early March to mid- or late April, after hibernation. Woodchucks are polygynous but only alpine and woodchuck marmot females have been shown to mate with multiple males. A mated pair remains in the same den throughout the 31- to 32-day gestation period. As birth of the young approaches in April or May, the male leaves the den. One litter is produced annually. Female woodchucks give birth to one to nine offspring, with most litters ranging between 3 and 5 pups. Groundhog mothers introduce their young to the wild once their fur is grown in and they can see. At this time, if at all, the father groundhog comes back to the family. By the end of August, the family breaks up; or at least, the larger number scatter, to burrow on their own.\n\nSection: Description\nThe groundhog is by far the largest sciurid in its geographical range, excepting British Columbia where its range may abut that of its somewhat larger cousin, the hoary marmot.

The genus Nestor contains four species: the New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis), the kea (N. notabilis), the extinct Norfolk kaka (N. productus), and the extinct Chatham kaka (N. chathamensis). All four are thought to stem from a \"proto-kākā\", dwelling in the forests of New Zealand five million years ago. Their closest relative is the flightless kakapo (Strigops habroptilus).

Murray's daughter Shannon Aceman stated in an interview that her grandmother's schmoo torte \"was basically a mix of about three or four of her other best-known recipes for cakes with the rum torte.\" Jewish food historian Kat Romanow told CTV News Winnipeg that schmoo is reminiscent of a central-European dessert called nusstorte. Romanow told CTV News: \"In many cases, the dishes that Ashkenazi Jews brought with them to Canada came to be iconic dishes of their new homes.\" How the schmoo got its name is unknown, however, some claim it comes from the name of the comic book creatures from Al Capp’s Li’l Abner.\n\nSection: See also\nList of desserts\n Food portal\nParagraph 1: List of desserts Food portal\n\nSection: External links\nRestaurant recipe\nParagraph 1: Restaurant recipe\n\n[Tree 2]\nTopic: Walnut pie\nTree ID: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_pie\nRoot score: 0.7551", "retrieved_roots": [{"tree_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmoo_torte", "score": 0.77311635, "topic": "Schmoo torte"}, {"tree_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_pie", "score": 0.7551143, "topic": "Walnut pie"}, {"tree_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_sandwich", "score": 0.75105894, "topic": "Tomato sandwich"}], "retrieved_root_count": 3, "retrieved_event_count": 9, "retrieved_leaf_count": 9}

The base of the mountain is composed of ancient Silurian and Ordovician rocks which are exposed in the valley bottoms to the north of Ingleton. A belt of Carboniferous Limestone, the 'Great Scar Limestone', some 600 feet (180 m) thick, lies on top of this. Due to the limestone's permeability, all the streams flowing down from the mountain are engulfed upon reaching it, falling into a number of potholes. Above lies the layered Yoredale Series of sedimentary rocks, predominantly shale and sandstone, and generally concealed by the peat but revealed in the escarpments about 1,700 feet (520 m) up. There are also layers of harder limestone sandwiched between the softer rocks which have been eroded faster, and which protect the layers beneath them, leading to the 'tiered' effect. The whole mountain, however, is protected from erosion by a cap of Millstone Grit approximately 100 feet (30 m) tall. The rock above the Millstone Grit layer has been eroded away, which explains the comparative flatness of the summit.

The Himalayan subspecies has a straighter profile, a lighter coloured forehead and ochre-tipped hairs on the lower back and rump. The Chinese subspecies has a more curved forehead and sloping snout, a darker coat with a less white face and more contrast between the tail rings. In 2020, results of a genetic analysis of red panda samples showed that the red panda populations in the Himalayas and China were separated about 250,000 years ago. The researchers suggested that the two subspecies should be treated as distinct species. Red Pandas in southeastern Tibet and northern Myanmar were found to be part of styani, while those of southern Tibet were of fulgens in the strict sense. DNA sequencing of 132 red panda faecal samples collected in Northeast India and China also showed two distinct clusters indicating that the Siang River constitutes the boundary between the Himalayan and Chinese red pandas. They probably diverged due to glaciation events on the southern Tibetan Plateau in the Pleistocene.\n\nSection: Etymology", "retrieved_roots": [{"tree_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda", "score": 0.84422207, "topic": "Red panda"}, {"tree_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_polecat", "score": 0.81433946, "topic": "European polecat"}, {"tree_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox", "score": 0.7734312, "topic": "Red fox"}], "retrieved_root_count": 3, "retrieved_event_count": 9, "retrieved_leaf_count": 9}
